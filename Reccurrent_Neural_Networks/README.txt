The notebooks 'news_notebook.ipynb' and 'clickbait_notebook.ipynb' contain the analysis implemented
with ML and DL techniques for the two different datasets, 
which are respectively 'news.csv' and 'clickbait.csv'.
The notebooks are already showing the results.
By re-running them, the first cell will ask the user to decide if to
select the hyperparameters of the networks or to use the pre-selected after our analysis.
By tiping 'no' in the pop-up cell, the pre-chosen parameters will be used,
otherwise, by tiping 'yes', the user will then be asked for the values of the different parameters.
Then, the rest of the notebook can be ran.
The files 'plot_functions.py' and 'evaluation.py' contain functions for the graphs and the evaluation
metrics on the predictions.
