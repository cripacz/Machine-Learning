The files NaiveBayes_PrimaryTumor.ipynb and NaiveBayes_DryBeans.ipynb contain the analysis performed on,
respectively, the dataset primary_tumor.csv and Dry_Beans.csv. The file NaiveBayes.py contains the implementation of the algorithm from scratch. 

The libraries used are numpy and pandas for managing data, matplotlib and seaborn for plotting,
and sklearn, which has been used only for comparison with other algorithms and some other 
tools, like the evaluation metrics.
