The files kNN_housing.ipynb and kNN_ailerons.ipynb contain the analysis performed on,
respectively, the dataset housing.csv and ailerons.csv. The file kNN_Regressor.py and
kNN_Regressor_Weighted.py contain the implementation of the algorithm from scratch 
(kNN regressor and weighted kNN regressor).

The libraries used are numpy and pandas for managing data, matplotlib and seaborn for plotting,
and sklearn, which has been used only for comparison with other algorithms and some other 
tools, like the evaluation metrics.
